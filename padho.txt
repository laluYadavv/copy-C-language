**Making an fibonacci code using recurrision:

1.What is fibonacci series?
 Fn = F(n − 1) + F(n − 2)
 It is just substract the num by one then two and then add the two results 
 That's it.

2. Just defined the base condition of 0 and 1 in that case the ans will be 0 and 1 itself also their always an base condition for an recurrsion code.

3. Then just apply the formula above and then make an main function(with an loop that repeat the code desire number of time).
4. That's it simple as fuck!!
